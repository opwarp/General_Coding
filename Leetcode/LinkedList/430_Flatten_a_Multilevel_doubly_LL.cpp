// You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer,
// which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their
// own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

// Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list.
// You are given the head of the first level of the list.

// Example:
// Input:
//  1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
//          |
//          7---8---9---10--NULL
//              |
//              11--12--NULL

// Output:
// 1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
