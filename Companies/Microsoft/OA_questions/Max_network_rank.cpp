// An infrastructure consisting of N cities, numbered from 1 to N, and M bidirectional roads between them is given.
// Roads do not intersect apart from at their start and end points (they can pass through underground tunnels to avoid collisions).
// For each pair of cities directly connected by a road, let's define their network rank as the total number of roads that are
// connected to either of the two cities.

// Write a function:
// class Solution { public int solution (int[] a, intu B, int n); }

// that, given two arrays A, B consisting of Mintegers each and an integer N, where A[U] and Bl√º are cities at the two ends
// of the i-th road, returns the maximal network rank in the whole infrastructure.

// Examples:
// 1. Given A = [1, 2, 3, 3), B = [2, 3, 1, 41 and N = 4, the function should return 4.
// The chosen cities may be 2 and 3, and the four roads connected to them are: (2, 1), (2,3), (3, 1), (3, 4).
